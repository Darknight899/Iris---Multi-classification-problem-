#Iris Flower Multi-classification Problem 
Week 3: A supervised machine learning project that implements a Decision Tree classifier to predict the Iris flower species based on their characteristics. Tools used in this assignment are as follows: Python 3.11, pandas(Data manipulation), scikit-learn (machine learning), and matplotlib (data visualization).

##Project Overview
This project uses the famous Iris dataset to build a multi-class classification model that can predict iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) from sepal and petal measurements.

##Objectives
- Implement a Decision Tree classifier for multi-class classification
- Visualize the decision tree structure
- Achieve high accuracy in species prediction (90%)

##Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal length(cm)
- Sepal width(cm) 
- Petal length(cm)
- Petal width(cm)

##Target classes:
- 0: Setosa
- 1: Versicolor
- 2: Virginica
